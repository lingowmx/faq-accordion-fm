## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- SASS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vite



### What I learned

I started wanting to practice more stuff thanthe one im use to, like using sass all the time thinking that will make it easier to work with the styles, but in this case make it so complicated. Also because i was using Vite and need to learn about it first.
So what i learned is, make it simple, then make it work, then you can do other stuff... üôÇ‚Äç‚ÜïÔ∏è
